# Bulk Update Trigger for XrmToolBox

**Bulk Update Trigger** is a plugin for [XrmToolBox](https://www.xrmtoolbox.com) that allows you to force the execution of update-triggered plugins, Power Automate flows, or workflows by "touching" selected fields on multiple records â€” without changing their values.

This tool is useful when you need to:
- Re-trigger logic tied to update events
- Simulate updates on selected fields
- Perform bulk updates using FetchXML filtering


## ðŸ“¦ Plugin Distribution

You can install the plugin directly from the **XrmToolBox Plugin Store** or reference it via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/).
